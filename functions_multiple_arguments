console.log("Hello students"); // It works.

const paintingWalls = function (specificWall, color){
    console.log("The " + specificWall + " wall has been painted " + color);
};

paintingWalls("south", "grey");

// The order of the arguments does matter when calling the function. Because otherwise it will give you 'The grey wall has been painted northern'.
// Changing only the function definition gives you: 'The grey wall has been painted northern'.
// Changing both the function definition aswell as the order of the arguments gives you the same result as the initial one.
